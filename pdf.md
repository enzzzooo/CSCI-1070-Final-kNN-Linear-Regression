# Detailed analysis of the project objectives and problem statement. Here you should clearly explain whatpredictive or classification problem is being addressed, and how it relates to the dataset and scope. Ifany critical decisions have been made about the project that were not explicitly stated in the projectdescription, include these as well.


# Detailed description of data handling and modelling components. Describe the datasets used, includingsources and key attributes. Explain the pre–processing steps such as feature transformation, normal-isation, and encoding necessary for kNN and linear regression models


# Detailed description of exploratory data analysis and results.  Present the exploratory data analysisprocess including key graphs (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) and data insights relevantto modelling. Follow this with a clear explanation of model training, evaluation metrics (such as accuracyfor classification and RMSE for regression), and comparison of model results. Include discussion oninterpretation and implications.
